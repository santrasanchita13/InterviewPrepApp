Interview Preparation App _ Sample app for LearnCodeOnline

This project is part of LearnCodeOnline.in company's recruitment process. It took me around 24 hours to create and test (you can check the commits).

Some of my signature characteristics are included - 
1. MVP architecture is used with dependency injection. So, the app is highly maintainable.
2. I have unit tested it and run instrumentation tests.
3. I have used google login since their website also uses google login.
